# FiveM Camera Bounty

#### `bara-camera-bounty`

**Camera Bounty** is a resource for FiveM that adds photography bounties to the game, encouraging players to explore the map and take photos of wildlife and nature.

Bounty zones appear on the map periodically. Players are paid based on their efforts â€” including whether they managed to photograph any animals and how far into the bounty zone they explored.

Built for **QBox** and uses **Renewed-Banking**.
